## Project Abstract

3D Printer G-CODE Validation and Security Application

The increasing accessibility of 3D printing has revolutionized manufacturing and prototyping or re-producing a part in a remote location. However, with the widespread us of printing 3D parts, there is a growing risk of maliciously altered or error-prone G-CODE files that could damage other equipment using the printed parts, or result in injury or fire. This project aims to develop an application to scan G-CODE files for potential threats or errors, ensuring safer and more reliable 3D printing.
The application will analyze G-CODE files to identify issues such as out-of-bound commands, excessive temperature settings, user error, or malicious codes. It will also create a check list for the user to properly print the part with success check for bad G-CODE and suggest corrective measures. The application will flag the G-CODE if the files are un-safe, problematic, or malicious. The application will provide a summary to the user.
The project’s goals include:
1.	Enhancing 3D printer safety by mitigating the risks of hardware damage or accidents.
2.	Streamlining the printing process by catching common errors before execution.
3.	Providing a user-friendly interface for reviewing identified issues with actionable suggestions for resolution.
This application has the potential to be a vital tool for 3D printing enthusiasts and professionals, ensuring higher print reliability, reduced downtime, and safer operation.


## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
