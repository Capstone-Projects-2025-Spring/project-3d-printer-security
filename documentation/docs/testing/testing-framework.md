# Testing Framework

The testing framework used is Pytest, selected due to its ease of use and its light weight. Additionally it
expediates the generation of coverage reports with the use of its coverage library,
this can be done with one command from the terminal and reduces the need for confusing integration into IDEâ€™s and disparate development environments.
