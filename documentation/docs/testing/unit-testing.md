# Unit tests

## Library Explanation

The only library explanation used is the [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) framework. This is a simple framework in which it also
provides test coverages. Since we are using Octoprint, their testing process is also the same framework.

## Execution of Tests

Test is yet to be written.

## Link to Test Coverage Report

Test is yet to be written, so no coverage report is provided.
