# Features and Requirements
## Functional Requirements
1. Background Execution:
* The executable must operate seamlessly in the background without user intervention.
2. 3D Model Scanning:
* The executable must scan pre-sliced 3D models to detect:Malicious code.
* Corrupt sections that may affect print integrity.
3. G-code Analysis:
* The executable must analyze Cura-generated G-code for: Path intersections along all axes.
* Temperature spikes in the print head.
* Excessive filament volume beyond specified thresholds.
4. Configuration Management:
* The executable must have an associated configuration file allowing customization of:
	* Maximum permitted filament volume.
	* Maximum allowable print head temperature.
5. Configuration Editor:
* An additional executable must be provided for intuitive editing of the configuration file.
6. Suspicious Activity Detection:
* Upon detecting suspicious G-code, the executable must raise an alert and prompt for manual approval before proceeding.

## Nonfunctional Requirements
1. Security Program Format:
* The security program must exist as an executable file.
2. System Performance:
* The executable must not impede the normal operations of the host computer system.
3. Seamless Launch:
* The executable must launch directly from the file without requiring additional input from the user.
4. File Monitoring Automation:
* The executable must automatically detect files that are sent to or generated by Cura, ensuring continuous monitoring without manual intervention.
