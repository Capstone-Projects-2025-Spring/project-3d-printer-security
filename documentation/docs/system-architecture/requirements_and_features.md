The system consists of different components

•	This application design requires a network to fully function properly.

•	Networking paradigm: Seamless communication between components.

•	Frontend Application: GUI-based interface for monitoring warnings before printing.

•	Backend Application: For handling G-Code Scanning and warning the client to take precautions before printing.

•	Database: This application will not require a database. However, it will provide a success / failure report the client.

•	3D-Printer Interface: A hardware running both client and or backend code for interacting with printers.
