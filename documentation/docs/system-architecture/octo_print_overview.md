# Octo Print Overview #

OctoPrint allows you to control every facet of the 3D printer and its capabilities. That is achieved by connecting to the application with your browser. However, we aim to use the OctoPrint API to control print jobs and monitor printing via the backend application running on some hardware on the network. The front-end app will not connect directly to OctoPrint however the client can be given privileges to connect to the OctoPrint Web services and monitor printing. The client will be interacting with the front-end app for sending print jobs.
