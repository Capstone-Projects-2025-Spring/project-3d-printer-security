# Import necessary libraries for monitoring temperature and controlling the printer
# Ensure you have the correct dependencies installed for OctoPrint

# Define constants for temperature thresholds
# Example: Set the maximum allowable temperature for the hotend and bed

# Function to read temperature data from the printer
# Use OctoPrint's API or another method to fetch real-time temperature readings

# Function to check if the temperature exceeds safe operating limits
# Compare current temperature with predefined thresholds
# If the temperature is too high, trigger a safety response

# Safety response function
# If overheating is detected:
#   - Pause or stop the print job
#   - Send an alert to the user (display a message in OctoPrint, send an email, etc.)
#   - Optionally, attempt to cool down the printer by turning off heating elements

# Function to log temperature data
# Store readings for debugging and analysis to identify potential issues

# Main loop or event-driven trigger
# Continuously monitor the printerâ€™s temperature while printing is active
# Call the safety check function at regular intervals

# If integrating with OctoPrint's plugin system, ensure proper setup for hooks
# Example: Register the script as an OctoPrint plugin and enable it to run automatically

# Handle exceptions and errors
# Ensure the script doesn't crash OctoPrint and provides meaningful error messages
